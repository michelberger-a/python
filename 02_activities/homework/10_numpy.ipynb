The formula for exponential growth is `population_size = N0 *e**rt`, where `N0` is the initial population, `e` is the exponential function, `r` is the rate, and `t` is time. Using this:\n","\n","1.   Set the initial population, `N0`, as 100 and the growth rate, `r`, as 0.4\n","2.   Use the suitable `numpy` function to generate an array of time points, `t`, which go from 0 to 10 seconds, in 0.2 second increments.\n","3.   Write an expression to evaluate `population_size`, which should be an array of the population size for each time point in `t`.\n","4.   Create a new variable called `population_size_noise`, use the same expression you wrote in parts (3), and add noise to the population at each time point. Do this by adding an expression that uses a `numpy` function to generate a random value for each time point drawn from a normal distribution of `mean=0` and `stdev=250` (i.e., population_size_noise = expression_from_part_a + expression_to_add_noise)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"ok","timestamp":1668296875008,"user":{"displayName":"Kaylie Lau","userId":"01284785813595846851"},"user_tz":300},"id":"ULSswoS4EhRs","outputId":"6d541d46-0b4f-4300-9d52-bfd6d4877aff"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Your code here\n","import numpy as np\n","N0 = 100\n","r = 0.4\n","t = np.arange(0, 10.2, 0.2)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["array([ 100.        ,  108.32870677,  117.3510871 ,  127.12491503,\n","        137.71277643,  149.18246976,  161.60744022,  175.06725003,\n","        189.64808793,  205.44332106,  222.55409285,  241.08997064,\n","        261.16964734,  282.92170144,  306.48542033,  332.01169227,\n","        359.66397256,  389.61933018,  422.0695817 ,  457.22251951,\n","        495.30324244,  536.55559711,  581.24373944,  629.6538261 ,\n","        682.09584693,  738.90560989,  800.44689143,  867.11376585,\n","        939.33312874, 1017.56743061, 1102.31763806, 1194.12644178,\n","       1293.58173155, 1401.32036077, 1518.0322245 , 1644.46467711,\n","       1781.42731796, 1929.79717555, 2090.52432351, 2264.63796432,\n","       2453.25301971, 2657.57726999, 2878.91908792, 3118.69581683,\n","       3378.44284638, 3659.82344437, 3964.63940726, 4294.84259788,\n","       4652.54744398, 5040.04447781, 5459.81500331])"]},"execution_count":5,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["population_size = N0 * np.exp(r*t)\n","population_size"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Population size with noise is:  [ 326.52063093   50.05643976  211.5137159   152.36621507  174.10192872\n","  644.02424451  495.67266312  482.73882948  272.74408687  152.89374918\n"," -283.993648    480.87371405  197.99924194  595.19920055  524.47982346\n","  125.41756197  527.36070837  868.48019166  679.4634153   278.59599816\n","  328.02886238  946.64795063  438.72611556  380.32396113  883.07181114\n"," 1034.77023432  379.71583846  619.70014618  939.28000219  866.20624095\n"," 1052.89573791  864.46035522 1822.19796905 1180.26717899 1642.11590048\n"," 1870.60886385 1478.53856691 2148.22083412 1896.53021755 2469.49216031\n"," 2836.85079027 2827.30984584 2861.40665565 2869.1042214  3623.97128424\n"," 3171.07019172 3825.89756788 3960.19277481 4564.46298169 5288.13144218\n"," 5475.24978382]\n"]}],"source":["# add noise to the expression\n","population_size_noise = population_size + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=250, size = np.shape(population_size))\n","print(\"Population size with noise is: \", population_size_noise)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<details>\n","  <summary>Answer</summary>\n","\n","  ```python\n","  import numpy as np\n","\n","  #set initial population\n","  N0 = 100\n","  #set growth rate\n","  rate = 0.4\n","  #create array of time points \n","  t = np.arange(start=0, stop=10.2, step=0.2)\n","\n","  #calculate population of colony at the time points in t\n","  population_size = N0 * np.exp(rate*t)\n","  print('Population size is: ',population_size)\n","\n","  #add noise to population at each time point\n","  population_size_noise = N0 * np.exp(rate*t) + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=250, size=np.shape(population_size))\n","  print('Population size with noise is: ',population_size_noise)\n","  ```\n","</details>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QmxvYhS3OCNJ"},"source":["### 2.
